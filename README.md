NotifyPropertyChangedBase provides a simple to use yet powerful base class `NotifyPropertyChanged` that implements the `INotifyPropertyChanged` interface. Whether you're writing UWP, Xamarin, WPF or any other app, it will help you work with data.

This is an open-source project so feel free to send a pull request or open an issue.

## How to use it?
NotifyPropertyChangedBase library helps you use `INotifyPropertyChanged` interface without needing to write your own logic. The one and only thing you need to do is to make your models inherit from the abstract class `NotifyPropertyChanged`. So instead of worrying about backing stores - variables that hold data of properties - about compairing data or calling the `PropertyChanged` event you will register your property and this class will do the rest.

It's usage is very similar to the usage of `DependencyObject`, that you may be familiar with from UWP or WPF, however it does **not** inherit from it nor it can only be used on the UI thread. **You can access it from any thread you want**.

To benefit from the advantages of NotifyPropertyChangedBase, you have to register your property using the `RegisterProperty` method. It has three required parameters and one overload accepting fourth parameter:
   - name of the property (using it you'll be accessing its value and doing all the work with the property)
   - type of the property
   - default value of the property
   - (optional) property changed callback - a method that will be invoked after given property changes, but before the `PropertyChanged` event is invoked, providing you info about the previous value of the property and it's new - current value

> Please note that unlike `DependencyProperty.Register` the `RegisterProperty` method here does **not** return anything and you don't have to store anything. You're accessing the property using only it's name.

To get and set values of registered properties you'll use `GetValue` and `SetValue` or `ForceSetValue`. The difference between `SetValue` and `ForceSetValue` is that the latter **always** sets the new value to a property and invokes the `PropertyChanged` event and registered callbacks, **no matter whether the value is different from the current one**. However `SetValue` checks whether the old value and the new one are differet using the `Equals` method (you may want to [override it](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.object.equals) to achieve the desired result on this check). `SetValue` assigns the new value and invokes the `PropertyChanged` event and registered callbacks **only** if the two values are **not** equal.

All these methods have an argument `propertyName` specifying which property are you working with but you can fully omit these as the compiler will pass the name of property/method from which these methods are called from because the argument has the [`CallerMemberNameAttribute`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.compilerservices.callermembernameattribute). `SetValue` and `ForceSetValue` have one another argument that is passed before the `propertyName` containing the value to be set to given property.

There's also the `OnPropertyChanged` method, also having a `propertyName` argument with the same attribute, which you can use to invoke the `PropertyChanged` event manually.

#### PropertyChangedCallback
Besides the `PropertyChanged` event that is invoked when any of the properties changes, NotifyPropertyChangedBase provides the `PropertyChangedCallback` that is registered for each property independently. Registered callbacks are invoked **always** before the `PropertyChanged` event.

There are two ways to register them - using overloaded `RegisterProperty` method which accepts a delegate of type `PropertyChangedCallback` as the last argument or using `RegisterPropertyChangedCallback`. The latter is designed to add another callback any time after registering the property. You can also unregister a callback, registered using whichever of those two methods, using the `UnregisterPropertyChangedCallback` method.

The handlers of these callbacks get two values as arguments - `sender` which holds the reference to the class that invoked that certain callback and `e` of type `PropertyChangedCallbackArgs` which has the following properties:

   - `Handled` - indicates whether this certain callback has been handled. Default value is `false`.
   - `OldValue` - holds the previous value of the related property.
   - `NewValue` - holds the current value of the related property.

#### Having a control over everything
Using the `IsPropertyChangedEventInvokingEnabled` and `IsPropertyChangedCallbackInvokingEnabled` properties you can enable/disable invocation of the `PropertyChanged` event or registered callbacks. Their default value is `true` but setting them to `false` will disable the respected events so even the `ForceSetValue` method will **not** be invoking them.

> Setting `IsPropertyChangedCallbackInvokingEnabled` to `false` will **not** unregister already registered callbacks.

#### Example
Here's a simple class using some advantages of NotifyPropertyChangedBase. It has two properties, `Bar` and `Greeting`. Both are backed by `NotifyPropertyChanged` class so anytime their value is changed, the `PropertyChanged` event is automatically invoked.

```csharp
    using NotifyPropertyChangedBase;

    class Foo : NotifyPropertyChanged
    {
        public int Bar
        {
            get { return (int)GetValue(); }
            set { SetValue(value); }

            // These will do the same:
            // get { return (int)GetValue(nameof(Bar)); }
            // get { return (int)GetValue("Bar"); }
        }
        public string Greeting
        {
            get { return (string)GetValue(); }
            set { SetValue(value); }
        }
    
        public Foo()
        {
            // Property without a callback
            RegisterProperty(nameof(Bar), typeof(int), 0);
            // This will do the same:
            // RegisterProperty("Bar", typeof(int), 0);

            // Property with a callback
            RegisterProperty(nameof(Greeting), typeof(string), null, GreetingPropertyChanged);
        }

        private void GreetingPropertyChanged(NotifyPropertyChanged sender, PropertyChangedCallbackArgs e)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Value of Greeting changed from '{e.OldValue}' to '{e.NewValue}'");
        }
    }
```

>I'm using the [`nameof`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/nameof) keyword but you can of course use just a string i.e. `"Bar"` etc. when working with properties.

This is just a simple example. Of course you can call `GetValue`, `SetValue` and `ForceSetValue` anywhere in the code, **not** only in the body of related properties but using `Bar = 5;` over `SetValue(5, nameof(Bar));` and so on seems much simpler to me.

#### Structure of the `NotifyPropertyChanged` class
All the members of this class (except of the `PropertyChanged` event) are `protected` so only derived classes can use them.
